# node-red-contrib-ikea-home-smart

Node-RED node to interface with IKEA smart home products as tradfri lights or blinds without any external binaries thanks to [node-tradfri](https://github.com/AlCalzone/node-tradfri-client).

* All operations (brightness, color temperature, color, etc.) supported by the gateway are available.
* Support for observation (i.e. reporting on changes to the light).

## Usage
There is one node for each accessory type (besides the config node). After the configuration has been successful -- either by providing an existing identity and PSK or by generating new ones by providing the security code from the gateway -- simply select which accessory or group to target and check if the node should observe the device as well.

### Controlling the node
Nodes can be programmatically controlled by sending a message with `msg.payload` set to one of the following strings:
* `"status"` The node will output the current status of its target accessory.

### Controlling the blinds
A blind's position can be controled by sending an object with the following property as `msg.payload` to the node.

* `"position"`: number - The position in percent [0..100%].

### Controlling the lights
Lightbulbs can be controlled by sending an object with one or more of the following properties as `msg.payload` to the node.

**All** of them support the most basic properties, which are
* `"dimmer"`: number - The brightness in percent [0..100%].
* `"onOff"`: boolean - If the lightbulb is on (true) or off (false)
* `"transitionTime"`: number - The duration of state changes in seconds. Default 0.5s, not supported for on/off.

**White spectrum** lightbulbs also support
* `"colorTemperature"`: number - The color temperature in percent, where 0% equals cold white and 100% equals warm white.

**RGB** lightbulbs have the following properties:
* `"color"`: string - The 6 digit hex number representing the lightbulb's color. Don't use any prefixes like "#", only the hex number itself!
* `"hue"`: number - The color's hue [0..360°].
* `"saturation"`: number - The color's saturation [0..100%].

### Controlling the plugs (Untested)
Control a plug by sending an object with the following property as `msg.payload` to the node.

* `"onOff"`: boolean - If the plug is on (true) or off (false).

### Controlling the groups
A group contains several devices, usually a remote control and either lightbulbs, plugs or blinds. To control the group send the following properties as `msg.payload` to the node:

**For a group of lights**
* `"dimmer"`: number - The brightness in percent [0..100%].
* `"onOff"`: boolean - If the lightbulb is on (true) or off (false)
* `"transitionTime"`: number - The duration of state changes in seconds. Default 0.5s, not supported for on/off.

**For a group of blinds**
* `"position"`: number - The position in percent [0..100%].

**For a group of plugs**
* `"onOff"`: boolean - If the plug is on (true) or off (false)

Additionally, this property is also supported:
* `"sceneId"`: number - Set this to the instanceId of a scene (or "mood" as IKEA calls them), to activate it.

### Status node output
If a status request is send or a device's state is updated, the node will respond with a `msg.payload` containing its current properties.

* `"name"`: string - The name of this accessory.
* `"createdAt"`: number - The unix timestamp of the creation of the device.
* `"instanceId"`: number - The ID under which the accessory is known to the gateway.
* `"type"`: number - The type of the accessory.

* `"alive"`: boolean - Whether the gateway considers this device as alive.
* `"lastSeen"`: number - The unix timestamp of the last communication with the gateway.
* `"otaUpdateState"`: number - Unknown. Might be a boolean
* `"deviceInfo"`: object - Some additional information about the device.
	- `"firmwareVersion"`: string - The firmware version of the device.
